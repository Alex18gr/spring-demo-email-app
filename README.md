# Spring Demo email application

This application is a demonstration of Spring email features. The templates are created with the help of Thymeleaf received from a database source.

The following libraries are used:

* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
* [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)

The database template resolver is inspired by the post [Thymeleaf views from database in Spring Boot](https://springhow.com/spring-boot-thymeleaf-views-from-database/).

## Template Examples

Some template examples are in the [templates folder](demo-templates)
